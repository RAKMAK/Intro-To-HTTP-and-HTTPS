# Intro-To-HTTP-and-HTTPS

A simple introduction to HTTP and HTTPS, the most popular protocols of the internet.

## How to use it ?

I have created this presentation in **jupyter notebook** with **RISE** plugin. TO get it up and running you need to have `pipenv` installed in your machine.


To get the presentation up and running use following commands

```
$ git clone https://github.com/RatanShreshtha/Intro-To-HTTP-and-HTTPS.git
$ cd Intro-To-HTTP-and-HTTPS
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell

```

And got to http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Intro%20To%20HTTP%20and%20HTTPS.ipynb and start slideshow.
